<h1>EvolveU's Front-End Section</h1>
<p>
   This project is a combination of multiple competencies with the concept of building on top of each other.<br/>
   Through this project, I've learned HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, state management, and TDD (with jest).

   As a class every week, we were assigned a problem to solve using JavaScript. This problem in particular involved a dataset from 4 Western Provinces. We had to write two functions. The first one processes the data and only selects the people from BC and AB. The second was to write a callback function that console.logs the people with their full name and is over 25 years of age.

   What you will find is a calculator, banking account with cards, a cities app that you can add a city and modify the population and an      example of a link list.
