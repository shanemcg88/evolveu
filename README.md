<h1>EvolveU's Front-End Section</h1>
<p>
   This project is a combination of multiple competencies with the concept of building on top of each other.<br/>
   Through these project, I've learned HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, state management, and TDD (with jest).

<h3>$practice folder</h3>
<p>
   As a class every week, we were assigned a problem to solve using JavaScript. This problem in particular involved a dataset from 4 Western Provinces. We had to write two functions. The first one processes the data and only selects the people from BC and AB. The second was to write a callback function that console.logs the people with their full name and is over 25 years of age.

<h3>dom folder</h3>
<p>
   There two sections in this assignment using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. The first section, "Basic DOM" shows a list starting with three items. I created three functionalities can that show/hide the list, add an item and delete an item.<br />
   The second section, "Working with Cards", involved adding cards that can render before or after the current card selected, delete the card and also keep count of each card.

<h3> src folder (React App)</h3>
<p>
   Our React Compentency are multiple assignments that build slightly on top of each other. They are each conditionally rendered using state management. You will find a basic calculator, a dynamic account banking list using cards. The city/community application allows you to add a city, modify it's population then it will detect whether it's a town/city/hamlet, etc. There's also an example of a linked list. Each of these components have their own test files using vanilla javascript.
