<h1>EvolveU's Front-End Section</h1>
<p>
   This project is a combination of multiple competencies using React with the concept of building on top of each other.<br/>
   Through this project, I've learned HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, state management, and TDD (with jest).

<p>
   What you will find is a calculator, banking account with cards, a cities app that you can add a city and modify the population and an      example of a link list.
